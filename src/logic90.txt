//
// Logic 90: Game-specific functions
//
// You should use this logic to perform any game specific functions, such as
// counting down timers, etc and processing player input related to the game
// (such as examining/using inventory items) and any other things that are
// required in several rooms that you don't want to duplicate in each room.
//
// This logic is called from logic 0, on every cycle.
// If you like, you could only make it called only when disable_game_functions
// is not set.
//
// Sierra did not use a separate logic for all this - they just did it all
// from logic 0. I find it is neater this way, as you can keep your game
// specific processing separate from other system-related things (although
// these may require some modification for your game). Also, this makes logic 0
// easier to manage.
